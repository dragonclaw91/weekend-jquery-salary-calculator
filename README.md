## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

the biggest problem ifaced when makeing this was getting the right things that were previoulsy deleted or already on the tale from being added when the submit button was clicked

I sloved this problem by adding before the for loop was run 
and after the delte function had run

 ## Installation

pretty straight forward just get the files downloaded and open the index.html in browser

 ## Usage

this is pretty stright forward in terms of funcionality it takes user input from the fields and adds them to a table it then adds the total monthly salary form all the inputed data if the monthly total exceeds 20k it lets the alerts the user to over spending by turning the amount displayed red
